# flask_tutorial
The files are linked together to show any user how to create a webpage if someone have a domain or not. 
In order to run the program run the following: 
First all of the files attached were placed within a file named flask-app
export FLASK_APP=app.py 
export FLASK_ENV=development //this will run a debugger and allow the user to make changes within the files without having to restart the program. 
flask run 

This was done by following the link attched below and simply has comments within the code to show new users how the functions within the files work.

Lazy way to run the program, copy and paste into terminal after transfering the files. (it will automatically run) 

export FLASK_APP=app.py 
export FLASK_ENV=development 
flask run
